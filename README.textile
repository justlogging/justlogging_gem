h1. Justlogging

This plugin enables easy logging from any Ruby application to our webservice. 

For other languages checkout: 
* http://www.github.com/justlogging/php_logger
* http://www.github.com/justlogging/python_logger

h2. Install

Just install it as a plugin:
<pre>
  <code>
  $ ./script/plugin install git://github.com/justlogging/rails_logger.git
  $ ./script/generate justlogging
  </code>
</pre>

The generator copies a file called @justlogging.rb@ to the @RAILS_ROOT/config/initializer@ directory. You need to set you api key there and optionally your default log key.

h2. Usage

@Justlogging.log('this is my first entry')@

Easy as pie.
